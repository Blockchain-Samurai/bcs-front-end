<!-- ======================================================  -->
<!--                   The Bushido Code                      -->
<!-- ======================================================  -->
<!--                Rectitude or Justice                     -->
<!--                         ----                            -->
<!-- 
    Rectitude or Justice, is the strongest virtue of Bushido. 
    A well-known samurai defines it this way: 

    Rectitude is one’s power to decide upon a course of 
    conduct in accordance with reason, without wavering; to 
    die when to die is right, to strike when to strike is 
    right.’ Another speaks of it in the following terms: 
    ‘Rectitude is the bone that gives firmness and stature. 
    Without bones the head cannot rest on top of the spine, 
    nor hands move nor feet stand. So without Rectitude 
    neither talent nor learning can make the human frame into 
    a samurai.’
-->
<!-- ======================================================  -->
<!--                        Courage                          -->
<!--                         ----                            -->
<!--
    Bushido distinguishes between bravery and courage:

    Courage is worthy of being counted among virtues only if 
    it’s exercised in the cause of Righteousness and Rectitude. 
    In his Analects, Confucius says: ‘Perceiving what is right 
    and doing it not reveals a lack of Courage.’ In short, 
    ‘Courage is doing what is right.’
-->
<!-- ======================================================  -->
<!--                  Benevolence or Mercy                   -->
<!--                         ----                            -->
<!--
    A man invested with the power to command–and the power 
    to kill–was expected to demonstrate equally extraordinary 
    powers of benevolence and mercy:

    Love, magnanimity, affection for others, sympathy and pity, 
    are traits of Benevolence, the highest attribute of the 
    human soul. Both Confucius and Mencius often said the highest 
    requirement of a ruler of men is Benevolence. 
-->
<!-- ======================================================  -->
<!--                      Politeness                         -->
<!--                         ----                            -->
<!--
    Discerning the difference between obsequiousness and 
    politeness can be difficult for casual visitors to Japan, 
    but for a true man, courtesy is rooted in benevolence:

    Courtesy and good manners have been noticed by every foreign 
    tourist as distinctive Japanese traits. But Politeness 
    should be the expression of a benevolent regard for the 
    feelings of others; it’s a poor virtue if it’s motivated only 
    by a fear of offending good taste. In its highest form 
    Politeness approaches love.
-->
<!-- ======================================================  -->
<!--                  Honesty and Sincerity                  -->
<!--                         ----                            -->
<!--
    True samurai, according to author Nitobe, disdained money, 
    believing that “men must grudge money, for riches hinder 
    wisdom.” Thus children of high-ranking samurai were raised 
    to believe that talking about money showed poor taste, and 
    that ignorance of the value of different coins showed good 
    breeding:

    Bushido encouraged thrift, not for economical reasons so 
    much as for the exercise of abstinence. Luxury was thought 
    the greatest menace to manhood, and severe simplicity was 
    required of the warrior class … the counting machine and 
    abacus were abhorred.
-->
<!-- ======================================================  -->
<!--                         Honor                           -->
<!--                         ----                            -->
<!--
    Though Bushido deals with the profession of soldiering, 
    it is equally concerned with non-martial behavior:

    The sense of Honor, a vivid consciousness of personal 
    dignity and worth, characterized the samurai. He was born
    and bred to value the duties and privileges of his 
    profession. Fear of disgrace hung like a sword over the 
    head of every samurai … To take offense at slight 
    provocation was ridiculed as ‘short-tempered.’ As the 
    popular adage put it: ‘True patience means bearing the 
    unbearable.’ 
-->
<!-- ======================================================  -->
<!--                        Loyalty                          -->
<!--                         ----                            -->
<!--
    Economic reality has dealt a blow to organizational 
    loyalty around the world. Nonetheless, true men remain 
    loyal to those to whom they are indebted:

    Loyalty to a superior was the most distinctive virtue of 
    the feudal era. Personal fidelity exists among all sorts 
    of men: a gang of pickpockets swears allegiance to its 
    leader. But only in the code of chivalrous Honor does 
    Loyalty assume paramount importance.
-->
<!-- ======================================================  -->
<!--               Character and Self-Control                -->
<!--                         ----                            -->
<!--
    Bushido teaches that men should behave according to an 
    absolute moral standard, one that transcends logic. What’s 
    right is right, and what’s wrong is wrong. The difference 
    between good and bad and between right and wrong are givens,
    not arguments subject to discussion or justification, and a 
    man should know the difference. Finally, it is a man’s 
    obligation to teach his children moral standards through the 
    model of his own behavior:

    The first objective of samurai education was to build up 
    Character. The subtler faculties of prudence, intelligence, 
    and dialectics were less important. Intellectual superiority 
    was esteemed, but a samurai was essentially a man of action.

                            <p>
                                Through extensive market research and analysis of existing blockchains with NFT functionality, we have determined that the benefits of development on the Cardano blockchain suit the needs of our project far better than competitors. Therefore, with the founding of our company in November of 2021, our development team decided that Blockchain Samurai would be developed on the Cardano blockchain.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The first step in our development process was to construct a foundation that would provide us with a solid base to build the key features of our project. This foundation primarily consists of our internal database of visual assets, planned content, and workflow procedures in addition to our website; blockchainsamurai.io. By continuously developing and discussing the many features that have been documented in our blog, we hope to ensure both openness and transparency for the Cardano community. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the Watanabe era, we plan to deliver the core infrastructure that will support the launch and scaling of our project while at the same time providing insight into our development progress for the community at large.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Much like the roadmap of IOHK and the Cardano Foundation, the Watanabe era is as much about developing a technological foundation as it is about developing a community. When looking at the NFT market at large, the community can be obviously cited as one of the most influential factors that determine the success of a project. Therefore, we aim to cater to the needs and interests of our community as Blockchain Samurai continues through development. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Watanabe era represents our first steps towards the creation of an immersive world that will define our project for years to come.

                            <p>
                                The goals of the Asahina era are similar to those of the Watanabe era in that technological growth and asset creation are among the core objectives of this period of development. In addition to these underlying goals, the main focus of the Asahina era is to enable the first iteration of our distribution methods which will allow for community members to mint NFTs directly from our website via Nami wallet integration.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This period of development is crucial to the long-term functionality of our project in addition to the retention of value that we hope the assets within our project will receive. The logic behind this statement largely relates to the non-traditional distribution methods that we are planning to implement, i.e. a community-driven development model. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The basis of the community-driven development model is a progressive series of NFT releases that will launch within separate seasons, each containing ten chapters. The chapters within the seasons will release independently of one another and feature one hundred samurai each. Therefore, ensuring that each chapter launches with ease is essential to our project's success and a significant goal of the Asahina era. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Through the use of this community-driven development model, our developers can take feedback from users and data from interactions within the Bushido Index and use it to make development decisions about the next season/chapter of blockchain samurai releases. Additionally, this method will allow our digital artists to add unique touches to new NFTs and potentially distinctive iterations of previously released NFTs. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Asahina era as a whole represents the official release of blockchain samurai that will provide the Cardano community with the opportunity to participate in our ever-expanding world.

                                By integrating drops into the blockchain samurai ecosystem, we can provide an additional layer of incentives that will produce value for the community. Through this integration, we aim to encourage our community to hold their samurai NFTs as opposed to selling them for a quick profit. As such, the overarching goal of the Nitta era is to design a series of NFTs that will be used to provide content drops to the community.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While the traditional appraisal methods of NFTs most commonly rely on an analysis of floor price, we believe in an approach where value is measured in the average time that our users hold their NFTs. Therefore, samurai holders will be incentivized to hold their NFTs with periodic item drops that will include objects such as weapons and artifacts.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As well as providing the beginnings of an incentive structure for our community, the Nitta era will also provide the basis for the beginnings of our interactive world. With the introduction of items and drops, players will gain the ability to view all of their items and samurai within their own personal dojo in the bushido index. The inclusion of the interactive dojo will give our community members a unique way to show off their collection and view their NFTs without the use of a third-party website.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Drops will also contain varying layers of complexity with the possibility for rare items or completely unique items that will serve additional functions during community interactions. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Nitta era represents an upgrade to the fundamentals of blockchain samurai which will reward our community for participating in this journey with us.

                                The Kumagai era of the development roadmap will be responsible for the introduction of many pieces of lore about the land of Hachi-Sho and its inhabitants. The goal of this era is to provide our community with a sense of ownership and knowledge about the world that they have chosen to participate in and become a part of.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Another core introduction in the Kumagai era is the development of the structure of an interactive pseudo-metaverse which we have named Hachi-Sho. It might also be noted that Hachi-sho will be released in an alpha state so that we can test for bugs and get feedback from the community. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The creation of the pseudo-metaverse is intended to provide further incentive structures for the community by rewarding them for interacting with their samurai clans as well as participating in battles and community events. To clarify, we have declared Hachi-Sho a pseudo-metaverse as there is no 2D or 3D exploration element to the intended design. We have instead opted into a tabletop RPG-type model in which players will make decisions as clan units that will impact the world and other clans based upon accumulated clan attributes, item buffs, and total samurai. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As mentioned above, community members will have incentives to participate within the clan and world activities so that they can ensure the survival and growth of their samurai and clan while at the same time potentially earning special reward drops.

                                The types of community interactions described above will allow us to deploy our methods of community-driven development in which the results of every story are to be played out by the decisions of the clans of Hachi-Sho. We believe that giving this power to the community is what it really means to own a part of an NFT project.

                                The Kumagai era represents the beginnings of a story that will be told and retold amongst the Cardano community for years to come.

                    <h1 class="display-4 header-font">Minamoto</h1>

                                Continuing on the foundation set by the previous eras, the Minamoto era will focus on refining every previously integrated feature and ultimately culminate in the full release of the Hachi-Sho pseudo-metaverse. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Minamoto era will also see the release of a few additional features such as an item shop to mint new items from the Bushido Index in addition to the Conquer Hachi-Sho mechanic. Conquer Hachi-Sho will feature a version of the interactive map of Hachi-Sho in which clans will compete to control the eight provinces of Hachi-Sho. Through the earlier proposed mechanisms of the Hachi-Sho pseudo-metaverse, clans will be able to participate in Conquer Hachi-Sho every season.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The results of Conquer Hachi-Sho at the end of each season will provide great rewards for each victorious clan with potentially detrimental consequences for the clans and samurai that suffer defeat. Such rewards could include very powerful items for use in the next season and potential consequences of defeat could result in the death of your samurai or clan. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Another feature to be implemented in the Minamoto era is the Ronin mechanic which will allow samurai with no clan designation to join a clan of their own choice or remain lone wolves. There will be forty-seven existing Ronin in season one and more could potentially be created with the death of clans.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The final feature to be implemented in the Minamoto era is the Emperor mechanic which will see the victors of each season of Conquer Hachi-Sho to name a new Emperor for the following season if the previous Emperor has been killed. The emperor will play a key role in each season of Conquer Hachi-Sho and will be able to make fully autonomous decisions for the Imperial Army and the Emperor’s Private Guard. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Minamoto era represents the final elements that will inspire an exciting and robust story to emerge from the world of Hachi-Sho with direct influence from the community that inhabits it.
