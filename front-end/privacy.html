<!-- ======================================================  -->
<!--                   The Bushido Code                      -->
<!-- ======================================================  -->
<!--                Rectitude or Justice                     -->
<!--                         ----                            -->
<!-- 
    Rectitude or Justice, is the strongest virtue of Bushido. 
    A well-known samurai defines it this way: 

    Rectitude is one’s power to decide upon a course of 
    conduct in accordance with reason, without wavering; to 
    die when to die is right, to strike when to strike is 
    right.’ Another speaks of it in the following terms: 
    ‘Rectitude is the bone that gives firmness and stature. 
    Without bones the head cannot rest on top of the spine, 
    nor hands move nor feet stand. So without Rectitude 
    neither talent nor learning can make the human frame into 
    a samurai.’
-->
<!-- ======================================================  -->
<!--                        Courage                          -->
<!--                         ----                            -->
<!--
    Bushido distinguishes between bravery and courage:

    Courage is worthy of being counted among virtues only if 
    it’s exercised in the cause of Righteousness and Rectitude. 
    In his Analects, Confucius says: ‘Perceiving what is right 
    and doing it not reveals a lack of Courage.’ In short, 
    ‘Courage is doing what is right.’
-->
<!-- ======================================================  -->
<!--                  Benevolence or Mercy                   -->
<!--                         ----                            -->
<!--
    A man invested with the power to command–and the power 
    to kill–was expected to demonstrate equally extraordinary 
    powers of benevolence and mercy:

    Love, magnanimity, affection for others, sympathy and pity, 
    are traits of Benevolence, the highest attribute of the 
    human soul. Both Confucius and Mencius often said the highest 
    requirement of a ruler of men is Benevolence. 
-->
<!-- ======================================================  -->
<!--                      Politeness                         -->
<!--                         ----                            -->
<!--
    Discerning the difference between obsequiousness and 
    politeness can be difficult for casual visitors to Japan, 
    but for a true man, courtesy is rooted in benevolence:

    Courtesy and good manners have been noticed by every foreign 
    tourist as distinctive Japanese traits. But Politeness 
    should be the expression of a benevolent regard for the 
    feelings of others; it’s a poor virtue if it’s motivated only 
    by a fear of offending good taste. In its highest form 
    Politeness approaches love.
-->
<!-- ======================================================  -->
<!--                  Honesty and Sincerity                  -->
<!--                         ----                            -->
<!--
    True samurai, according to author Nitobe, disdained money, 
    believing that “men must grudge money, for riches hinder 
    wisdom.” Thus children of high-ranking samurai were raised 
    to believe that talking about money showed poor taste, and 
    that ignorance of the value of different coins showed good 
    breeding:

    Bushido encouraged thrift, not for economical reasons so 
    much as for the exercise of abstinence. Luxury was thought 
    the greatest menace to manhood, and severe simplicity was 
    required of the warrior class … the counting machine and 
    abacus were abhorred.
-->
<!-- ======================================================  -->
<!--                         Honor                           -->
<!--                         ----                            -->
<!--
    Though Bushido deals with the profession of soldiering, 
    it is equally concerned with non-martial behavior:

    The sense of Honor, a vivid consciousness of personal 
    dignity and worth, characterized the samurai. He was born
    and bred to value the duties and privileges of his 
    profession. Fear of disgrace hung like a sword over the 
    head of every samurai … To take offense at slight 
    provocation was ridiculed as ‘short-tempered.’ As the 
    popular adage put it: ‘True patience means bearing the 
    unbearable.’ 
-->
<!-- ======================================================  -->
<!--                        Loyalty                          -->
<!--                         ----                            -->
<!--
    Economic reality has dealt a blow to organizational 
    loyalty around the world. Nonetheless, true men remain 
    loyal to those to whom they are indebted:

    Loyalty to a superior was the most distinctive virtue of 
    the feudal era. Personal fidelity exists among all sorts 
    of men: a gang of pickpockets swears allegiance to its 
    leader. But only in the code of chivalrous Honor does 
    Loyalty assume paramount importance.
-->
<!-- ======================================================  -->
<!--               Character and Self-Control                -->
<!--                         ----                            -->
<!--
    Bushido teaches that men should behave according to an 
    absolute moral standard, one that transcends logic. What’s 
    right is right, and what’s wrong is wrong. The difference 
    between good and bad and between right and wrong are givens,
    not arguments subject to discussion or justification, and a 
    man should know the difference. Finally, it is a man’s 
    obligation to teach his children moral standards through the 
    model of his own behavior:

    The first objective of samurai education was to build up 
    Character. The subtler faculties of prudence, intelligence, 
    and dialectics were less important. Intellectual superiority 
    was esteemed, but a samurai was essentially a man of action.
